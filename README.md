This repository contains a collection of AI-powered agents and tools built with LangChain, demonstrating various applications of large language models in practical scenarios. The project features an AI Writing Agent that uses a multi-agent system with specialized roles (planner and writer) to create structured content, a Course Automation Agent that provides intelligent study assistance by retrieving information from PDF course materials using vector search and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and a Resume Review Agent specifically designed for investment banking applications that provides detailed, section-by-section feedback with scoring and actionable improvement suggestions. Each agent showcases different LangChain capabilities including document processing, vector stores, prompt engineering, and multi-agent coordination, making this repository an excellent resource for understanding how to build production-ready AI applications with LangChain.
